# Rules & Guidelines [IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ]

### **To ensure a fair, fun, and innovative environment, please adhere to the following rules:**

- **Team Size**
    - Each team must have a maximum of 3 members
    - If you do not have a team currently, we highly recommend hopping into our developer discord [**here](http://discord.gg/monaddev).**
        - You will be automatically assigned a Monad Blitz Delhi role after joining the server.
        - You can then head to the Monad Blitz Bangalore Forum to introduce yourself and team up.

- **Fresh Ideas Only (No Pre-Built Projects):**
    - All projects must be new and conceived specifically for Monad Blitz.
    - You **cannot** submit existing projects, fork existing codebases (beyond standard libraries/boilerplates), or continue work on personal projects you've already started. The spirit is to build something fresh.
    
- **Start Your Engines at Blitz:**
    - All project development (coding, asset creation, etc.) must begin **during** the official Monad Blitz event hours.
    
- **Pre-Blitz Brainstorming & Planning Encouraged:**
    - While coding starts at Blitz, we **highly encourage** you to perform research, brainstorm ideas, and formulate a plan for what you intend to build *before* the event. Come prepared with a concept!
    
- **Innovate, Don't Just Replicate:**
    - We strongly discourage building direct clones of existing applications without introducing significant innovation or a unique Monad-specific twist.
    - **The Goal:** This isn't about creating the most polished application; it's about trying out genuinely new ideas, experimenting with novel mechanics, and using the day to innovate with valuable feedback from your peers. Ask yourself: "What new problem am I solving, or how am I solving an old problem in a radically new way on Monad?"
    
- **Public & Deployed for All:**
    - All submissions must be made public (e.g., a public GitHub repository).
    - Your project must be deployed and operational on the **Monad Testnet** for demonstration and review.
    

Adherence to these guidelines ensures a level playing field and keeps the focus squarely on innovation and learning.
